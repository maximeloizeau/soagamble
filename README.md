It is an implementation of an automatic gambling system specially designed for the course "Architecture for Service-based systems".

The application is divided into three parts: Workflow editor, workflow parser/visualizer, and the application allowing to launch the betting sequences and to display the results from the betting services.

The back-end consists of a RSP (Reseach Service Platform) project embedded in a GWT project in order to communicate between the front and the back-end (see diagram).


Libraries
=========

GWTEventService (https://code.google.com/p/gwteventservice/) : to realize the communication between the GWT server and the GWT client.

Snap.svg (http://snapsvg.io) : to facilitate the drawing of shapes in SVG
